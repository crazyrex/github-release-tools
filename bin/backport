const description = `\
Backports change(s) in a PR to a release branch and opens a pull request for review.

<change> can be one of the following:

* A commit hash
* The URL to a pull request
* The ID of a pull request, preceded by a hash sign, e.g. #893

<branch> is the name of a release branch, e.g. \`release-boba\`.

backport will do the following:

1. In the case where <change> is a commit hash, locate the PR in which the change originated.
2. Create a branch named cherry-pick-<pr>, where <pr> is the ID of the originating PR.
3. Cherry pick each commit in the originating PR onto this branch, with an opportunity to resolve conflicts should they arise.
4. Open a PR requesting a merge of cherry-pick-<pr> to <branch>, with a description that notes the originating PR and reproduces its description.
5. Request a review from the reviewer(s) of the original PR.
